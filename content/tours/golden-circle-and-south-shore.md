Your best choice, TWO TOURS IN ONE, especially for a short visit to Iceland by luxury jeep. We take you in small group to the most breath-taking places in Iceland in one day. From Reykjavik we drive through the South shore farmland with view of the volcano Eyjafjallajökull (E15). We touch blue-ice glacier,- waterfalls and walk on the black beach. Then we drive into the Golden circle with the our most famous waterfall “Gullfoss”, the real Geyser and Strokkur. We also visit the National park “Þingvellir” where we view the tectonic plates drift apart.
